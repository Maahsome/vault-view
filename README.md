# vault-view

CLI tool with TUI interface used to browse Hashicorp Vault secret stores

The `derailed/k9s` project has inspired me.  A great number of CLI utilities
ran through my head.  A TUI CLI for browsing Hashicorp vault may not be something
that is needed, though it should be fun to try to create an experience similar to
the k9s interface.  So much coolness.
